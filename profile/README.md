## Project Purpose

OpenEBS is an open-source storage service for Kubernetes applications. OpenEBS manages the block storage and file systems based on the block storage for containers running in Kubernetes. Use OpenEBS for creating fast and resilient storage; with options for single-node, and replicated multi-node storage.

OpenEBS is a Stateful Persistent block-mode Data Storage platform with a native virtual SAN fabric; for Kubernetes. We are a CNCF member project. We are the largest global community of K8s storage users.<BR>
<BR>
Our project team was an early pioneering inventor of K8s **Container Native Storage** services (we invented the term). We conceived the vision of a Stateful Persistent data platform for K8s that is tightly integrated and natively embedded into the core of K8s.<BR>
<BR>
We built an innovative High-performance Enterprise grade Block-mode Hyper-converged Storage virtual SAN Fabric that augments the storage services of K8s with Stateful Persistence, Enterprise Data mgmt, SSD/NVMe optimized I/O services, Replicated Data volumes, Thin Provisioning, Snapshot, Clones; and many other Mission critical data storage services that ```don't come``` in K8s out-of-the-box.<BR>

## Why OpenEBS?
OpenEBS provides enterprise-grade data management for Kubernetes clusters, with five different storage engines (four single-node and one replicated) that meet a range of use cases for Kubernetes users. The five engines are summarized in the table below:
<BR>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The OpenEBS platform, provides 2 types of K8s Storage Services. ```Replicated PV``` and ```Local PV```.
<BR>

| Engine | [Local PV HostPath](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) | [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) | [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv)  | [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) | [Replicated PV Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor) |

We are an Ultra modern Data storage platform stack that is strongly aligned with the cutting-edge direction of storage use cases in the K8s industry. OpenEBS is designed to facilitate modern K8s datastore architectures, key K8s I/O patterns, K8s data access methods, K8s data use-cases and where K8s Datastore applications are heading.
<BR>	

OpenEBS is optimized for NVMe and SSD Flash storage media and integrates ultra-modern cutting-edge high-performance storage technologies at its core.</summary>

> [!WARNING]
> ### ```LEGACY Edition```
> Legacy has been <KBD> archived </KBD> and migrated out of the main OpenEBS parent repo.
```Erlang
LEGACY consists of Data-Engines that we experimented with early on. These Data-Engines have a number of open-source
technologies embedded inside them, and are a great intro into the world of simple K8s storage services. LEGACY helped
us learn, iterate, and develop our core storage K8s strategy, as well as discern how users want & need to interact with
K8s storage services. LEGACY also helped to reveal key areas within K8s that are lacking in storage/datastore services,
what areas of K8s we could optimize; and how we can provide the best value into the various K8s storage layers.
```

<BR>

There are multiple Storage Engines within LEGACY:<BR>
