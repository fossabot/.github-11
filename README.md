OpenEBS is a free openesource Stateful Persistent Data Storage platform for Kubernetes.<BR>
We are CNCF member project, with a large global community of K8s Datastorage users.<BR>
<BR>
Our project team was an early pioneering inventor of K8s Container Native Storage services. We concieved the vision of a K8s Stateful Persistent data platform that is tightly integrated and embeded natively into the core of K8s.<BR>
<BR>
We have designd and built an innovative ultra High-performance Enterprise grade Block-mode storage Hyper-converged Data Fabric that augments the core storage services of K8s with Stateful Persistence, Enterprise Data mgmt, SSD/NVMe optomized I/O services,
Replicated Data volumes, Thin Provisioning, Snapshot and Clones; and many other critical data storage services that don't come in K8s out-of-the-box.<BR>
<BR>
Building an Enterprise Data Storage platform is complex, and areas of the Data & I/O stack could be considerd 'Rocket science'. Our global team comes from many areas of the data storage industry and our project is sponsored by many innovative data storage companies within the industry, as well as many amazing individuals. Coding, contribuing, brainstorming ideas to the project are all welcome.<BR>

# Project structure
As a project, OpenEBS has kept up a steady pace of evolution in order to keep in alignment with the K8s overall and with the rapid changing pace of
technologies, hardware and software innovations in the data stroage industry. The proejct is divided into 2 main areas:
* Legacy
* Standard
