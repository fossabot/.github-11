OpenEBS is a free openesource Stateful Persistent Data Storage platform for Kubernetes.<BR>
We are CNCF member project, with a large global community of K8s Datastorage users.<BR>
<BR>
Our project team was an early pioneering inventor of K8s Container Native Storage services. We concieved the vision of a K8s Stateful Persistent data platfoprm that is deeply integrated and embeded natively into the core of K8s.<BR>
We have designd and built an innovative ultra High-performance Enterprise grade Block-mode storage Hyper-converged Data Fabric that augments the core storage services of K8s with Stateful Persistence, Enterprise Data mgmt, SSD/NVMe optomized I/O services,
Replicated Data volumes, and many other critical data storage services that don't come in K8s out-of-the-box.<BR>
